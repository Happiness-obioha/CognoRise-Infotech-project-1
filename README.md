## Introduction:

This Power BI Project is an analysis of **80 different breakfast cereals**, with the goal of determining how to choose healthy and nutritious cereals. 
The dataset includes various attributes such as cereal name, manufacturer, calories, sugar content, and other nutritional information.

## Contents:

### The dataset contains the following fields:

-	Name: Name of cereal
-	mfr: Manufacturer
-	A = American Home Foods Products;
-	G = General Mills
-	K = Kellogg's
-	N = Nabisco
-	P = Post
-	Q = Quaker Oats
-	R = Ralston Purina

## type:

-	cold
-	hot
-	calories: calories per serving
-	protein: grams of protein
-	fat: grams of fat
-	carbo: grams of complex carbohydrates
-	sugars: grams of sugars
-	sodium: milligrams of sodium
-	fiber: grams of dietary fiber
-	potass: milligrams of potassium
-	vitamins: vitamins and minerals – 0, 25, or 100, indicating the percentage
  of recommended FDA
-	shelf: display shelf (1,2, or 3, counting from the floor)
-	weight: weight in ounces of one serving
-	cups: number of cups in one serving

## Problem Statement:

1.	which manufacturers produce cereals with the
    highest calories?
2.	which nutrients are most important for a cereal to
    receive a good rating?
3.	is there a relationship between sugars, calories, carbs, fat and cereal’s rating?
4.	which shelf has the highest number of cereals?

## Concepts demostrated:

The following Power BI features were incorporated:
-	DAX,
-	Filters,
-	Slicers,
-	Cards,
-	Insert

## Analysis:
1.	Highest and Lowest Ratings: All-Bran with extra fiber has the highest rating,
   while Cap ‘n’ Crunch has the lowest rating. Both has the same vitamins level of 25.
2.	Cereal type and rating: Cereal type Cold has the highest and lowest ratings 
   compared to cereal type Hot.
3.	Manufacturer ratings: Manufacturer of Kellogg’s has the highest rating of 93.70%,
	 while manufacturer of Quaker Oats has the lowest rating of 18.04%
4.	Shelf ratings: Shelf 1 has the highest average rating of 46.1%, followed by
5.	shelf 3 and then shelf 2.

## Recommendations:

1.	Choose cereals with high fiber content: The analysis suggests that cereals with
higher fiber content tends to have better ratings. This is because fiber is an 
essential nutrient that can help with digestion and satiety.
2.	Consider cereals with moderate calorie counts as they tend to have better ratings.
This is because such cereals provide a balance between nutrition and taste.
3.	Opt for cereals with lower sugar content: These cereals are generally rated higher
because excessive sugar consumption can lead to various health issues.
4.	Check the manufacturer: The analysis highlights that cereals from certain manufacturers,
such as Kellogg’s and General Mills tend to have better ratings and this could be due to
their reputation for producing high-quality products.
